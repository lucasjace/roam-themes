Welcome to my current Roam Research theme(s)!

[Overview of custom themes in Roam](https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1268426724254945280?s=20)

### Dreamsicle ###

This theme is primarily based on the "Roam Railcast" theme by Jeff Harris, with tweaks to colors and other small changes.

Thanks, Jeff!

### Atomic ###

This is based on the Dark Cyan theme by Maximilian Schulz (https://twitter.com/maxwschulz),
which leverages code from the "Roam Railcast" theme by Jeff Harris.

Thanks, Maximilian & Jeff!

### Use these themes in your Roam ###

To add either of these themes to your Roam, copy the line below to your `[[roam/css]]` page and it will apply automatically.

If you want to also use the custom tags, you will need to copy that line separately (as shown in the screenshots).
