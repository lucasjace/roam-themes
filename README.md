Welcome to my current Roam Research theme(s)!

[Overview of custom themes in Roam](https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1268426724254945280?s=20)

### Use these themes in your Roam ###

To add either of these themes to your Roam, copy the line below to your `[[roam/css]]` page and it will apply automatically.

If you want to also use the custom tags, you will need to copy that line separately (as shown in the screenshots).

Please feel free to fork or copy if you prefer to make changes to the code!

* _Dreamsicle:_
@import url('https://lucasjace.github.io/roam-themes/dreamsicle.css');

* _Atomic:_

* _Custom Tags:_

### Dreamsicle ###

This theme is primarily based on the ["Roam Railcast" theme by Jeff Harris](https://github.com/jmharris903/Railscast-for-Roam-Research-Theme), with tweaks to colors and other small changes.

Thanks, Jeff!

### Atomic ###

Atomic is a bit cleaner and less colorful than Dreamsicle. It is based on the [Dark Cyan theme](https://www.notion.so/Dark-Cyan-Theme-for-Roam-Research-b06aaf0b0664458b91f25d17fe305318) by [Maximilian Schulz](https://twitter.com/maxwschulz),
which leverages code from the ["Roam Railcast" theme by Jeff Harris](https://github.com/jmharris903/Railscast-for-Roam-Research-Theme).

Thanks, Maximilian & Jeff!
